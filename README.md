# ebfm_abramov
This repository contains the energy-balance and firn model code, model forcing data and grid topo used for the paper "Long-term firn and mass balance modelling for Abramov glacier, Pamir Alay" by Marlene Kronenberg and colleagues.

The code is based on the work by Ward van Pelt. See also https://github.com/wardvp/EBFM-glacier
